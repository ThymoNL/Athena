# PHASCHNG IS THE MAIN WAY OF MAKING PHASE CHANGES FOR RESTARTS.  THERE ARE THREE FORMS OF PHASCHNG, KNOWN AS TYPE
# A, TYPE B, AND TYPE C. THEY ARE ALL CALLED AS FOLLOWS, WHERE OCT XXXXX CONTAINS THE PHASE INFORMATION,
#
#		TC	PHASCHNG
#		OCT	XXXXX
#
# TYPE A IS CONCERNED WITH FIXED PHASE CHANGES, THAT IS, PHASE INFORMATION THAT IS STORED PERMANENTLY.  THESE
# OPTIONS ARE, WHERE G STANDS FOR A GROUP AND .X FOR THE PHASE,
#
#	G.0		INACTIVE, WILLNOT PERMIT A GROUP G RESTART
#	G.1		WILL CAUSE THE LAST DISPLAY TO BE REACTIVATED, USED MAINLY IN MANNED FLIGHTS
#	G.EVEN		A DOUBLE TABLE RESTART, CAN CAUSE ANY COMBINATION OF TWO JOBS, TASKS, AND/OR
#			LONGCALL TO BE RESTARTED.
#	G.ODD NOT .1	A SINGLE TABLE RESTART, CAN CAUSE EITHER A JOB, TASK, OR LONGCALL RESTART
#
# THIS INFORMATION IS PUT INTO THE OCTAL WORD AFTER TC PHASCHNG AS FOLLOWS
#
#	TL0 00P PPP PPP GGG						  ,
#
# WHERE EACH LETTER OR NUMBER STANDS FOR A BIT.  THE G:S STAND FOR THE GROUP, OCTAL 1 - 7, THE P:S FOR THE PHASE,
# OCTAL 0 - 127.  0:S MUST BE 0.              IF ONE WISHES TO HAVE THE TBASE OF GROUP G TO BE SET AT THIS TIME,
# T IS SET TO 1, OTHERWISE IT IS SET TO 0.  SIMIARLY IF ONE WISHES TO SET LONGBASE, THEN L IS SET TO 1, OTHERWISE
# IT IS SET TO 0.  SOME EXAMPLES,
#
#		TC	PHASCHNG	THIS WILL CAUSE GROUP 3 TO BE SET TO 0,
#		OCT	00003		MAKING GROUP 3 INACTIVE
#
#		TC	PHASCHNG	IF A RESTART OCCURS THIS WOULD CAUSE
#		OCT	00012		GROUP 2 TO RESTART THE LAST DISPLAY
#
#		TC	PHASCHNG	THIS SETS THE TBASE OF GROUP 4 AND IN
#		OCT	40064		CASE OF A RESTART WOULD START UP THE TWO
#					THINGS LOCATED IN THE DOUBLE 4.6 RESTART
#					LOCATION
#		TC	PHASCHNG	THIS SETS LONGBASE AND UPON A RESTART
#		OCT	20135		CAUSES 5.13 TO BE RESTARTED (SINCE
#					LONGBASE WAS SET THIS SINGLE ENTRY
#					SHOULD BE A LONGCALL)
#		TC	PHASCHNG	SINCE BOTH TBASE4 AND LONGBASE ARE SET,
#		OCT	60124		4.12 SHOULD CONTAIN BOTH A TASK AND A
#					LONGCALL TO BE RESTARTED
#
# TYPE C PHASCHNG CONTAINS THE VARIABLE TYPE OF PHASCHNG INFORMATION.  INSTEAD OF THE INFORMATION BEING IN A
# PERMANENT FORM, ONE STORES THE DESIRED RESTART INFORMATION IN A VARIABKE LOCATION. THE BITS ARE AS FOLLOWS,
#
#	TL0 1AD XXX CJW GGG
#
# WHERE EACH LETTER OR NUMBER STANDS FOR A BIT.  THE G:S STAND FOR THE GROUP, OCTAL 1 - 7.  IF THE RESTART IS TO
# BE BY WAITLIST, W IS SET TO 1, IF IT IS A JOB, J IS SET TO 1, IF IT IS A LONGCALL, C IS SET TO 1. ONLY ONE OF
# THESE THREE BITS MAY BE SET.  X:S ARE IGNORED  1 MUST BE 1, AND 0 MUST BE 0.  AGAIN T STANDS FOR THE TBASE,
## Page 1404
# AND L FOR LONGBASE.  THE BITS A AND D ARE CONCERNED WITH THE VARIABLE INFORMATION. IF D IS SET TO 1, A PRIORITY
# OR DELTA TIME WILL BE READ FROM THE NEXT LOCATION AFTER THE OCTAL INFORMATION, IF THIS IS TO BE INDIRECT, THAT
# IS, THE NAME OF A LOCATION COMT+INING THE INFORMATION (DELTA TIME ONLY), THEN THIS IS GIVEN AS THE -GENADR OF
# THAT LOCATION WHICH CONTAINS THE DELTA TIME.  IF THE OLD PRIORITY OR DELTA TIME IS TO BE USED, THAT WHICH IS
# ALREADY IN THE VARIABLE STORAGE, THEN D IS SET TO 0. NEXT THE A BIT IS USED.  IF IT IS SET TO 0, THE ADDRESS
# THAT WOULD BE RESTARTED DURING A RESTART IS THE NEXT LOCATION AFTER THE PHASE INFORMATION, THAT IS, EITHER
# (TC PHASCHNG) +2 OR +3, DEPENDING ON WHETHER D HAD BEEN SET OR NOT.  IF A IS SET TO 1, THEN THE ADDRESS THAT
# WOULD BE RESTARTED IS THE 2CADR THAT IS READ FROM THE NEXT TWO LOCATIONS.  EXAMPLES,
#
#	AD	TC	PHASCHNG	THIS WOULD CAUSE LOCATION AD +3 TO BE
#	AD+1	OCT	05023		RESTARTED BY GROUP THREE WITH A PRIORITY
#	AD+2	OCT	23000		OF 23.  NOTE UPON RETURNING IT WOULD
#	AD+3				ALSO GO TO AD+3
#
#	AD	TC	PHASCHNG	GROUP  1 WOULD CAUSE CAUSE CALLCALL TO
#	AD+1	OCT	27441		BE STARTED AS A LONGCALL FROM THE TIME
#	AD+2   -GENADR	DELTIME		STORED IN LONGBASE (LONGBASE WAS SET) BY
#	AD+3	2CADR	CALLCALL	A DELTATIME STORED IN DELTIME.  THE
#	AD+4				BBCON OF THE 2CADR SHOULD CONTAIN THE E
#	AD+5				BANK OF DELTIME. PHASCHNG RETURNS TO
#					LOCATION AD+5
#
# NOTE THAT IF A VARIABLE PRIORITY IS GIVEN FOR A JOB, THE JOB WILL BE RESTARTED AS A NOVAC IF THE PRIORITY IS
# NEGATIVE, AS A FINDVAC IF THE PRIORITY IS POSITIVE.
#
# TYPE B PHASCHNG IS A COMBINATION OF VARIABLE AND FIXED PHASE CHANGES. IT WILL START UP A JOB AS INDICATED
# BELOW AND ALSO START UP ONE FIXED RESTART, THAT IS EITHER AN G.1 OR A G.ODD OR THE FIRST ENTRY OF G.EVEN
# DOUBLE ENTRY.  THE BIT INFORMATION IS AS FOLLOWS,
#
#	TL1 DAP PPP PPP GGG
#
# WHERE EACH LETTER OR NUMBER STANDS FOR A BIT.  THE G:S STAND FOR THE GROUP, OCTAL 1 - 7. THE P:S FOR THE FIXED
# PHASE INFORMATION, OCTAL 0 - 127. 1 MUST BE 1.  AND AGAIN T STANDS FOR THE TBASE AND L FOR LONGBASE.  D THIS
# TIME STANDS ONLY FOR PRIORITY SINCE THIS WILL BE CONSIDERED A JOB, AND IT MUST BE GIVEN DIRECTLY IF GIVEN.
# AGAIN A STANDS FOR THE ADDRESS OF THE LOCATION TO BE RESTARTED, 1 IF THE 2CADR IS GIVEN, OR 0 IF IT IS TO BE
# THE NEXT LOCATION.(THE RETURN LOCATION OF PHASCHNG) EXAMPLES,
#
#	AD	TC	PHASCHNG	TBASE IS SET AND A RESTART CAUSE GROUP 3
#	AD+1	OCT	56043		TO START THE JOB AJOBAJOB WITH PRIORITY
#	AD+2	OCT	31000		31 AND THE FIRST ENTRY OF 3.4SPOT (WE CAN
#	AD+3	2CADR	AJOBAJOB	ASSUME IT IS A TASK SINCE WE SET TBASE3)
#	AD+4				UPON RETURN FROM PHASCHNG CONTROL WOULD
#	AD+5				GO TO AD+5
#
#	AD	TC	PHASCHNG	UPON A RESTART THE LAST DISPLAY WOULD BE
#	AD+1	OCT	10015		RESTARTED AND A JOB WITH THE PREVIOUSLY
#	AD+2				STORED PRIORITY WOULD BE BEGUN AT AD+2
#					BY MEANS OF GROUP 5

# THE NOVAC-FINDVAC CHOICE FOR JOBS HOLDS HERE ALSO - NEGATIVE PRIORITY CAUSES A NOVAC CALL, POSITIVE A FINDVAC.

# 2PHSCHNG IS USED WHEN ONE WISHES TO START UP A GROUP OR CHANGE A GROUP WHILE UNDER THE CONTROL OF A DIFFERENT
# GROUP. FOR EXAMPLE, CHANGE THE PHASE OF GROUP 3 WHILE THE PORTION OF THE PROGRAM IS UNDER GROUP 5. ALL 2PHSCHNG
# CALLS ARE MADE IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER,
#
#		TC	2PHSCHNG
#		OCT	XXXXX
#		OCT	YYYYY
#
# WHERE OCT XXXXX MUST BE OF TYPE A AND OCT YYYYY MAY BE OF EITHER TYPE A OR TYPE B OR TYPE C.  THERE IS ONE
# DIFFERENCE --- NOTE- IF LONGBASE IS TO BE SET THIS INFORMATION IS GIVEN IN THE OCT YYYYY INFORMATION, IT WILL
# BE DISREGARDED IF GIVEN WITH THE OCT XXXXX INFORMATION. A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES MAY HELP,
#
#	AD	TC	2PHSCHNG	SET TBASE3 AND IF A RESTART OCCURS START
#	AD+1	OCT	40083		THE TWO ENTRIES IN 3.8 TABLE LOCATION
#	AD+2	OCT	05025		THIS IS OF TYPE C, SET THE JOB TO BE
