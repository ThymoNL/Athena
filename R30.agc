#  NEW FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION-	   CALLED BY VERB 82 ENTER.  PRIORITY 7
#    USED THROUGHOUT.		   CALCULATE AND DISPLAY ORBITAL PARAMETERS
#
# 1. IF AVERAGE G IS OFF:
#	  FLASH DISPLAY V04N12. R2 INDICATES WHICH SHIP'S STATE VECTOR IS
#	   TO BE UPDATED. INITIAL CHOICE IS THIS SHIP (R2=1). ASTRONAUT
#	   CAN CHANGE TO OTHER SHIP BY V22EXE, WHERE X NOT EQ 1.
#	   FLASH DISPLAY TIME V06N16. INITIAL CHOICE = 0 = PRESENT TIME.
#	   ASTRONAUT CAN INSERT A TIME BY V25E, R1=HR R2=MIN R3=CSEC.
#	   CHOSEN STATE VECTOR UPDATED TO CHOSEN TIME BY THISPREC/OTHPREC
#	  CALLS SR30.1 (WHICH CALLS TFFCONMU + TFFRP/RA) TO CALCULATE
#	   RPER (PERIGEE RADIUS), RAPO (APOGEE RADIUS), HPER (PERIGEE
#	   HEIGHT ABOVE LAUNCH PAD OR LUNAR LANDING SITE), HAPO (APOGEE
#	   HEIGHT AS ABOVE), TPER (TIME TO PERIGEE), TFF (TIME TO
#	   INTERSECT 300 KFT ABOVE PAD OR 35KFT ABOVE LANDING SITE).
#	  FLASH MONITOR V16N44 (HAPO, HPER, TFF).TFF IS -59M59S IF IT WAS
#	   NOT COMPUTABLE, OTHERWISE IT INCREMENTS ONCE PER SECOND.
#	   IF P00 IS RUNNING, CALL DELRSPL SPLASH ERROR COMPUTATION.
#	   ASTRONAUT HAS OPTION TO MONITOR TPER BY KEYING IN N 32 E.
#	   DISPLAY IS IN HMS, IS NEGATIVE (AS WAS TFF), AND INCREMENTS
#	   ONCE PER SECOND ONLY IF TFF DISPLAY WAS -59M59S.
#
# 2. IF AVERAGE G IS ON:
#	  CALLS SR30.1 APPROX EVERY TWO SECS.  STATE VECTOR IS ALWAYS
#	   FOR THIS VEHICLE. V82 DOES NOT DISTURB STATE VECTOR.  RESULTS
#	   OF SR30.1 ARE RAPO, RPER, HAPO, HPER, TPER, TFF.
#	  FLASH MONITOR V16N44 (HAPO, HPER, TFF).
#	   IF MODE IS P11, THEN CALL DELRSPL SO ASTRONAUT CAN MONITOR
#	   RESULTS BY N50E. SPLASH COMPUTATION DONE ONCE PER TWO SECS.
#
#
# ADDENDUM: HAPO AND HPER SHOULD BE CHANGED TO READ HAPOX AND HPERX IN THE
#	    ABOVE REMARKS.
