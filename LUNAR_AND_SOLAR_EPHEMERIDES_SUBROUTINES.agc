# LUNAR AND SOLAR EPHEMERIDES SUBROUTINES
#
# FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
#
#	THESE SUBROUTINES ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE POSITION AND VELOCITY
#	VECTORS OF THE SUN AND THE MOON RELATIVE TO THE EARTH AT THE
#	SPECIFIED GROUND ELAPSED TIME INPUT BY THE USER.
#
#	THE POSITION OF THE MOON IS STORED IN THE COMPUTER IN THE FORM OF
#	A NINTH DEGREE POLYNOMIAL APPROXIMATION WHICH IS VALID OVER A 15
#	DAY INTERVAL BEGINNING SHORTLY BEFORE LAUNCH.  THEREFORE THE TIME
#	INPUT BY THE USER SHOULD FALL WITHIN THIS 15 DAY INTERVAL.
# 
##	The 9th-degree polynomial spoken of here is a pad load, meaning
##	that it is not actually hardcoded into the software.  Additional
##	information about calculating the polynomial can be found on the 
##	<a href="http://nassp.sourceforge.net/wiki/Lunar_Ephemeris_Polynomials">
##	<b>Orbiter</b> NASSP wiki</a>, as well as information about calculation
##	of the <a href="http://nassp.sourceforge.net/wiki/Solar_Ephemeris">
##	solar ephemerides</a>.
#
#	LSPOS COMPUTES THE POSITION VECTORS OF THE SUN AND THE MOON.
#
#	LUNPOS COMPUTES THE POSITION VECTOR OF THE MOON.
#
#	LUNVEL COMPUTES THE VELOCITY VECTOR OF THE MOON.

#
# INPUT
#
#	1) SPECIFIED GROUND ELAPSED TIME IN CS X B-28 LOADED IN MPAC.
#
#	2) TIMEMO - TIME AT THE CENTER OF THE RANGE OVER WHICH THE LUNAR
#	   POSITION POLYNOMIAL IS VALID IN CS X B-42.
#
#	3) VECOEM - VECTOR COEFFICIENTS OF THE LUNAR POSITION POLYNOMIAL
#	   LOADED IN DESCENDING SEQUENCE IN METERS/CS**N X B-2
#
#	4) RESO - POSITION VECTOR OF THE SUN RELATIVE TO THE EARTH AT
#	   TIMEMO IN METERS X B-38.
#
#	5) VESO - VELOCITY VECTOR OF THE SUN RELATIVE TO THE EARTH AT
#	   TIMEMO IN METERS/CS X B-9.
# 
#	6) OMEGAES - ANGULAR VELOCITY OF THE VECTOR RESO AT TIMEMO IN
#	   REV/CS X B+26.
#
#	ALL EXCEPT THE FIRST INPUT ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRE-LAUNCH
#	ERASABLE DATA LOAD.
#
# OUTPUT - LSPOS
#
#	1) 2D OF VAC AREA CONTAINS THE POSITION VECTOR OF THE SUN RELATIVE
## Page 790
#	   TO THE EARTH AT TIME INPUT BY THE USER IN METERS X B-38.
#
#	2) MPAC CONTAINS THE POSITION VECTOR OF THE MOON RELATIVE TO THE
#	   EARTH AT TIME INPUT BY THE USER IN METERS X B-29.
#
# OUTPUT - LUNPOS
#
#	MPAC CONTAINS THE POSITION VECTOR OF THE MOON RELATIVE TO THE
#	EARTH AT THE TIME INPUT BY USER IN METERS X B-29.
#
# OUTPUT - LUNVEL
#
#	MPAC CONTAINS THE VELOCITY VECTOR OF THE MOON RELATIVE TO THE
#	EARTH AT TIME INPUT BY THE USER IN METERS/CS X B-7.
#
# SUBROUTINES USED
#
#	NONE
#
# REMARKS
#
#	THE VAC AREA IS USED FOR STORAGE OF INTERMEDIATE AND FINAL RESULTS
#	OF COMPUTATIONS.
#
#	S1, X1 AND X2 ARE USED BY THESE SUBROUTINES.
#	PRELAUNCH ERASABLE DATA LOAD ARE ONLY ERASABLE STORAGE USED BY
#	THESE SUBROUTINES.
#	RESTARTS DURING OPERATION OF THESE SUBROUTINES MUST BE HANDLED BY
#	THE USER.
